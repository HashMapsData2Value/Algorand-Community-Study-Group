# Algorand Community Study Group
Welcome to the Algorand Community Study Group repository üòäü´∂üèø

Please refer to #cryptography-study-group in [the Algorand discord server](https://discord.com/invite/YgPTCVk).

## Background

A lot of effort is being put into educating and recruiting developers to build on Algorand. This includes making the development experience much better with initiatives like AlgoKit. However, to truly go far in blockchain development and create state-of-the-art applications, it is not enough to learn the SDKs or how to write PyTeal, you also need to understand applied cryptography.

Unfortunately, learning applied cryptography is easier said than done as it requires an understanding of university-level mathematics and computer science concepts. It's also a field that has been progressing very, very fast, spurred on by the invention of blockchains. 

The Algorand Community Study Group was created to make that prospect less daunting, to provide a community in the Algorand ecosystem that can help bridge the gap.

Note that that the study group is not a formal course or a university class. There is no one to hold your hand, it's up to you to go through the resources and put in the time to learn the necessary concepts. 

You are however very much encouraged to ask in the channel(s) any questions you might have, and everyone is encouraged to treat any person and their questions with the respect and kindness the community has become known for.

1. "Fundamentals": Newcomers need a starting point. This directory contains a list of resources for getting the fundamentals necessary to be up-to-speed.

2. "Focus Topics": Periodically the group will pick a topic and focus on it. This directory contains resources, links and community notes for each topic.
