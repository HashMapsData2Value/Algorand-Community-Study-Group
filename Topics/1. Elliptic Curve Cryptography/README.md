# 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) \[2023-04-23\]

Our first topic to study is Elliptic Curve Cryptography. End date: \[2023-04-23\] 

Chapter 15 of Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup's _A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography_ (version 0.6) will serve as our main material. It's made up of 66 pages of contents and sub-chapters include:
- 15.1 The group of points on an elliptic curve
- 15.2 Elliptic curves over finite fields
- 15.3 Elliptic curve cryptography
- 15.4 Pairing based cryptography
- 15.5 Signature schemes from pairings
- 15.6 Advanced encryption schemes from pairings
- 15.7 The functional encryption paradigm
- 15.8 Multilinear Maps
- 15.9 A fun application: fair exchange of signatures
- 15.10 Notes
- 15.11 Exercises

The topic itself is quite large but will serve as an excellent basis for future topics (e.g. Groth16 zk-SNARKs). It also coincides well with [this PR](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/pull/4924/files) which will add EC-related opcodes to the AVM.
