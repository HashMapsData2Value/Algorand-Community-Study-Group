# Topics

Periodically we as a study group will pick a topic and explore it.

- 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- 2: L1s, L2s, and alternative blockchains



## Suggestions for future topics

Here are some suggestions for future topics. We'll have to evaluate over time what makes sense in terms of scope and theme.

- Lattice-based Cryptography (State Proofs/FALCON Keys, Learning with Errors, FHE?)

- Monero's Tech (Ring Signatures, Bulletproofs, ...)

- ZK-SNARKs (Groth16, PLONK, ...)

- Casino games with hidden state (IOHK-sponsored Royale, Kaleidoscope, 21; ZK proof of correctness of shuffles...)

- Algorand Foundation's research into SMPC ([SPRINT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/427), [TCaaS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3559397), [NI-PVSS](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-06944-4_16))
